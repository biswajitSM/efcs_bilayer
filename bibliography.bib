The nanoantennas are prepared by attaching one or two gold nanoparticles (NPs) to DNA origami structures, which also incorporated docking sites for a single fluorescent dye next to one NP or in the gap between two NPs. We measured the dependence of the fluorescence enhancement on NP size and number and compare it to numerical simulations. A maximum of 117-fold fluorescence enhancement was obtained for a dye molecule positioned in the 23-nanometer gap between 100-nanometer gold NPs. Direct visualization of the binding and unbinding of short DNA strands, as well as the conformational dynamics of a DNA Holliday junction in the hotspot of the nanoantenna, show the compatibility with single-molecule assays.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the distance-dependent quenching of fluorescence due to a metallic nanoparticle in proximity of a fluorophore. In our single-molecule measurements, we achieve excellent control over structure and stoichiometry by using self-assembled DNA structures (DNA origami) as a breadboard where both the fluorophore and the 10 nm metallic nanoparticle are positioned with nanometer precision. The single-molecule spectroscopy method employed here reports on the co-localization of particle and dye, while fluorescence lifetime imaging is used to directly obtain the correlation of intensity and fluorescence lifetime for varying particle to dye distances. Our data can be well explained by exact calculations that include dipole-dipole orientation and distances. Fitting with a more practical model for nanosurface energy transfer yields 10.4 nm as the characteristic distance of 50% energy transfer. The use of DNA nanotechnology together with minimal sample usage by attaching the particles to the DNA origami directly on the microscope coverslip paves the way for more complex experiments exploiting dye-nanoparticle interactions.},

The local field enhancement leads to an increased excitation rate whereas nonradiative energy transfer to the particle leads to a decrease of the quantum yield (quenching). Because of these competing effects, previous experiments showed either fluorescence enhancement or fluorescence quenching. By varying the distance between molecule and particle we show the first experimental measurement demonstrating the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement to fluorescence quenching. This transition cannot be explained by treating the particle as a polarizable sphere in the dipole approximation.},

  Abstract                 = {Cell membranes are typically very complex, consisting of a multitude of different lipids and proteins. Supported lipid bilayers are widely used as model systems to study biological membranes. Atomic force microscopy and force spectroscopy techniques are nanoscale methods that are successfully used to study supported lipid bilayers. These methods, especially force spectroscopy, require the reliable preparation of supported lipid bilayers with extended coverage. The unreliability and a lack of a complete understanding of the vesicle fusion process though have held back progress in this promising field. We document here robust protocols for the formation of fluid phase DOPC and gel phase DPPC bilayers on mica. Insights into the most crucial experimental parameters and a comparison between DOPC and DPPC preparation are presented. Finally, we demonstrate force spectroscopy measurements on DOPC surfaces and measure rupture forces and bilayer depths that agree well with X-ray diffraction data. We also believe our approach to decomposing the force-distance curves into depth sub-components provides a more reliable method for characterising the depth of fluid phase lipid bilayers, particularly in comparison with typical image analysis approaches.},

We demonstrate here that DNA-templated 60 and 80 nm diameter gold nanoparticle dimers, featuring one fluorescent molecule, provide single-photon emission with lifetimes that can fall below 10 ps and typical quantum yields in a 45-70% range. Since these colloidal nanostructures are obtained as a purified aqueous suspension, fluorescence spectroscopy can be performed on both fixed and freely diffusing nanostructures to quantitatively estimate the distributions of decay rate and fluorescence intensity enhancements. These data are in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations and demonstrate that millions of bright fluorescent nanostructures, with radiative lifetimes below 100 ps, can be produced in parallel.},

  Abstract                 = {A photon interacts efficiently with an atom when its frequency corresponds exactly to the energy between two eigenstates. But at the nanoscale, homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings strongly hinder the ability of solid-state systems to absorb, scatter or emit light. By compensating the impedance mismatch between visible wavelengths and nanometre-sized objects, optical antennas can enhance light–matter interactions over a broad frequency range. Here we use a DNA template to introduce a single dye molecule in gold particle dimers that act as antennas for light with spontaneous emission rates enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude and single photon emission statistics. Quantitative agreement between measured rate enhancements and theoretical calculations indicate a nanometre control over the emitter-particle position while 10 billion copies of the target geometry are synthesized in parallel. Optical antennas can thus tune efficiently the photo-physical properties of nano-objects by precisely engineering their electromagnetic environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) has become an important and widely used technique for many applications in physics, chemistry, and biology. Usually, FCS is measured with sensitive light detectors working in the photon-counting Geiger mode. A common property of such detectors is afterpulsing: the generation of spurious photon detection events after a genuine photon detection. Such afterpulsing causes a significant deviation of the measured autocorrelation function from its true value on a short time scale and can seriously influence derived parameters for fast processes such as triplet-state photophysics. Here, we discuss the impact of afterpulsing on FCS in detail. A new method is developed to eliminate afterpulsing effects by using time-correlated single-photon counting for separating the true fluorescence signal from afterpulsing events.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental observations and theoretical treatments are carried out for the band shape and relative intensity of the emission from gold nanorods of various aspect ratios in the range between 2.25 (1.5 theory) and 6.0 (9 theory). The calculation of the fluorescence spectra requires knowledge of the nanorod size distribution, the enhancement factors, and the shape of the unenhanced fluorescence spectrum. The size distribution is determined from the fit of the observed absorption spectrum for each value of aspect ratio studied to the theoretical model of Gans. The theory by Boyd and Shen is used for calculating the enhancement of the fluorescence spectrum of the previously observed weak emission of bulk gold, which originates from the interband transition. This is carried out for nanorods of different aspect ratios. To compare theory to the observed nanorod fluorescence spectra, which suffer from self-absorption, the calculated nanorod fluorescence spectra are corrected for this effect using the observed absorption spectra. The comparison between the observed and the calculated fluorescence band shapes is found to be good. The calculated changes in the relative intensities upon changing the aspect ratios are found to be much greater than that observed. This is due to the fact that for the observed emission of all the nanorods studied nonradiative processes dominate the relaxation mechanism of the excited state, a fact that was not included in the theoretical treatments.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel blurring-free stencil lithography patterning technique for high-throughput fabrication of large-scale arrays of nanoaperture optical antennas. The approach relies on dry etching through nanostencils to achieve reproducible and uniform control of nanoantenna geometries at the nanoscale, over millimeter-sizes in a thin aluminum film. We demonstrate the fabrication of over 400 000 bowtie nanoaperture (BNA) antennas on biocompatible substrates, having gap sizes ranging from (80 &#xB1; 5) nm down to (20 &#xB1; 10) nm. To validate their applicability on live cell research, we used the antenna substrates as hotspots of localized illumination to excite fluorescently labeled lipids on living cell membranes. The high signal-to-background afforded by the BNA arrays allowed the recording of single fluorescent bursts corresponding to the passage of freely diffusing individual lipids through hotspot excitation regions as small as 20 nm. Statistical analysis of burst length and intensity together with simulations demonstrate that the measured signals arise from the ultraconfined excitation region of the antennas. Because these inexpensive antenna arrays are fully biocompatible and amenable to their integration in most fluorescence microscopes, we foresee a large number of applications including the investigation of the plasma membrane of living cells with nanoscale resolution at endogenous expression levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is widely applied in chemistry, biology, and nanosciences to assess distances on sub-10 nm scale. Extending the range and applicability of FRET requires enhancement of the fluorescence energy transfer at a spatial scale comparable to the donor-acceptor distances. Plasmonic nanoantennas are ideal to concentrate optical fields at a nanoscale fully matching the FRET distance range. Here, we present a resonant aluminum nanogap antenna tailored to enhance single molecule FRET. A 20 nm gap confines light into a nanoscale volume, providing a field gradient on the scale of the donor-acceptor distance, a large 10-fold increase in the local density of optical states, and strong intensity enhancement. With our dedicated design, we obtain 20-fold enhancement on the fluorescence emission of donor and acceptor dyes, and most importantly up to 5-fold enhancement of the FRET rate for donor-acceptor separations of 10 nm. We also provide a thorough framework of the fluorescence photophysics occurring in the nanoscale gap volume. The presented enhancement of energy transfer flow at the nanoscale opens a yet unexplored facet of the various advantages of optical nanoantennas and provides a new strategy toward biological applications of single molecule FRET at micromolar concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular diffusion in biological membranes is a determining factor in cell signaling and cell function. In the past few decades, three main fluorescence spectroscopy techniques have emerged that are capable of measuring molecular diffusion in artificial and biological membranes at very different concentration ranges and spatial resolutions. The widely used methods of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single-particle tracking (SPT) can determine absolute diffusion coefficients at high (>100 μm−2) and very low surface concentrations (single-molecule level), respectively. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), on the other hand, is well-suited for the intermediate concentration range of about 0.1–100 μm−2. However, FCS in general requires calibration with a standard dye of known diffusion coefficient, and yields only relative measurements with respect to the calibration. A variant of FCS, z-scan FCS, is calibration-free for membrane measurements, but requires several experiments at different well-controlled focusing positions. A recently established FCS method, electron-multiplying charge-coupled-device-based total internal reflection FCS (TIR-FCS), referred to here as imaging TIR-FCS (ITIR–FCS), is also independent of calibration standards, but to our knowledge no direct comparison between these different methods has been made. Herein, we seek to establish a comparison between FRAP, SPT, FCS, and ITIR–FCS by measuring the lateral diffusion coefficients in two model systems, namely, supported lipid bilayers and giant unilamellar vesicles.},

The method is validated by precisely placing single fluorescent dyes with respect to ​gold nanoparticles as well as with respect to the excitation polarization using DNA origami nanostructures. Following validation, measurements in zeromode waveguides reveal that suppression of the radiative rate and enhancement of the non-radiative rate lead to a reduced quantum yield. Because the method exploits the intrinsic blinking of dyes, it can generally be applied to fluorescence measurements in arbitrary nanophotonic environments.},

Gold nanorods can be cheaply synthesized in large volumes, yet we find similar fluorescence enhancements as literature reports on lithographically fabricated nanoparticle assemblies. The fluorescence of a weak emitter, crystal violet, can be enhanced more than 1000-fold by a single nanorod with its SPR at 629 nm excited at 633 nm. This strong enhancement results from both an excitation rate enhancement of &#x223C;130 and an effective emission enhancement of &#x223C;9. The fluorescence enhancement, however, decreases sharply when the SPR wavelength moves away from the excitation laser wavelength or when the SPR has only a partial overlap with the emission spectrum of the fluorophore. The reported measurements of fluorescence enhancement by 11 nanorods with varying SPR wavelengths are consistent with numerical simulations.},

Here we demonstrate successful FCS measurements on a 1 μM solution of crystal violet (CV) dye in glycerol using a gold nanorod antenna. Our correlation analysis yields two components: (i) a slow component with correlation time of about 100 ms, which is attributed to sticking and bleaching of the dye, and (ii) a fast component of about 1 ms, which could arise from dye diffusion through the near-field of the nanorod and/or from blinking due to intersystem crossing or photochemistry.},

  Abstract                 = {Owing to the size mismatch between light and nanoscale objects such as single molecules, it is important to be able to control light–molecule interactions1, 2, 3, 4. Plasmonic nanoantennas create highly enhanced local fields when pumped resonantly, leading to increased Raman scattering5, but whether fluorescence enhancement occurs depends upon a variety of factors. Although sharp metal tips6 and colloids7, 8 can enhance fluorescence, the highly enhanced optical fields of lithographically fabricated bowtie nanoantennas9 provide a structure that is more controllable and amenable to integration. Using gold bowties, we observe enhancements of a single molecule's fluorescence up to a factor of 1,340, ten times higher than reported previously7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Electromagnetic simulations reveal that this is a result of greatly enhanced absorption and an increased radiative emission rate, leading to enhancement of the intrinsic quantum efficiency by an estimated factor of nine, despite additional non-radiative ohmic effects. Bowtie nanoantennas thus show great potential for high-contrast selection of single nanoemitters.},

Comparisons with three-dimensional calculations guide us to decipher the contributions of the excitation enhancement, spontaneous emission modification, and quenching.

  Abstract                 = {Fluorescence spectroscopy is a widely used research tool in biochemistry and molecular biology. Fluorescence has also become the dominant method enabling the revolution in medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and genomics. To date all the fluorescence observables, including spectral shifts, anisotropies, quantum yields, and lifetimes, have all been utilized in basic and applied uses of fluorescence. In this forward-looking article we describe a new opportunity in fluorescence, radiative decay engineering (RDE). By RDE we mean modifying the emission of fluorophores or chromophores by increasing or decreasing their radiative decay rates. In most fluorescence experiments the radiative rates are not changed because these rates depend on the extinction coefficient of the fluorophore. This intrinsic rate is not changed by quenching and is only weakly dependent on environmental effects. Spectral changes are usually caused by changes in the nonradiative rates resulting from quenching or resonance energy transfer. These processes affect the emission by providing additional routes for decay of the excited states without emission. In contrast to the relatively constant radiative rates in free solution, it is known that the radiative rates can be modified by placing the fluorophores at suitable distances from metallic surfaces and particles. This Review summarizes results from the physics literature which demonstrate the effects of metallic surfaces, colloids, or islands on increasing or decreasing emissive rates, increasing the quantum yields of low quantum yield chromophores, decreasing the lifetimes, and directing the typically isotropic emission in specific directions. These effects are not due to reflection of the emitted photons, but rather as the result of the fluorophore dipole interacting with free electrons in the metal. These interactions change the intensity and temporal and spatial distribution of the radiation. We describe the unusual effects expected from increases in the radiative rates with reference to intrinsic and extrinsic biochemical fluorophores. For instance, the decreased lifetime can result in an effective increase in photostability. Proximity to nearby metallic surfaces can also increase the local field and modify the rate of excitation. We predict that the appropriate localization of fluorophores near particles can result in usefully high emission from “nonfluorescent” molecules and million-fold increases in the number of photons observable from each fluorophore. We also describe how RDE can be applied to medical testing and biotechnology. As one example we predict that nearby metal surfaces can be used to increase the low intrinsic quantum yields of nucleic acids and make unlabeled DNA detectable using its intrinsic metal-enhanced fluorescence.},

  Abstract                 = {Metallic nano-antennas provide strong field confinement and intensity enhancement in hotspots and thus can ultimately enhance fluorescence detection and provide ultra small detection volumes. In solution-based fluorescence measurements, the diffraction limited focus driving the nano-antenna can outshine the fluorescence originating from the hotspot and thus render the benefits of the hotspot negligible. We introduce a model to calculate the effect of a nano-antenna, or any other object creating a nontrivial intensity distribution, for fluorescence fluctuation measurements. Approximating the local field enhancement of the nano-antenna by a 3D Gaussian profile, we show which hotspot sizes and intensities are the most beneficial for an FCS measurement and compare it to realistic antenna parameters from literature.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is an important technique for studying biochemical interactions dynamically that may be used in vitro and in cell-based studies. It is generally claimed that FCS may only be used at nM concentrations. We show that this general consensus is incorrect and that the limitation to nM concentrations is not fundamental but due to detector limits as well as laser fluctuations. With a high count rate detector system and applying laser fluctuation corrections, we demonstrate FCS measurements up to 38 μM with the same signal-to-noise as at lower concentrations. Optical nanoconfinement approaches previously used to increase the concentration range of FCS are not necessary, and further increases above 38 μM may be expected using detectors and detector arrays with higher saturation rates and better laser fluctuation corrections. This approach greatly widens the possibilities of dynamic measurements of biochemical interactions using FCS at physiological concentrations.},

The fluorescence from the organic fluorophores that are embedded in a mesostructured silica shell around individual gold nanorods is enhanced by the longitudinal plasmon resonance of the nanorods. Our electrostatic calculations show that under an off-resonance excitation, the electric field intensity contour around a nanorod rotates away from the length axis as the excitation polarization is varied. The polarization dependence of the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence is ascribed to the dependence of the averaged electric field intensity enhancement within the silica shell on the excitation polarization. The measured fluorescence enhancement factor is in very good agreement with that obtained from the electrostatic calculations. The fluorescence enhancement factor increases as the longitudinal plasmon wavelength is synthetically tuned close to the excitation wavelength. In addition, the polarization dependence is used to determine the orientation angle of the gold nanorods. The results are in excellent agreement with the actual measurements. Furthermore, the emission spectrum of the fluorophore is modified by the longitudinal plasmon resonance of the gold nanorods. A linear correlation between the emission peak wavelength and the longitudinal plasmon wavelength is obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is used for preparing gold NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 10 for which the surface plasmon absorption maxima are between 600 and 1300 nm. This method has been adapted from a previously published seed-mediated growth method (Jana et al. Adv. Mater. 2001, 13, 1389). The disadvantages and limitations of the earlier method (i.e., formation of noncylindrical NRs, φ-shaped particles, and formation of a large fraction of spherical particles) have been overcome by use of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-capped seed instead of a citrate-capped one. In a single-component surfactant system, the silver content of the growth solution was used to grow NRs to a desired length. This results in reproducible formation of NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. To grow longer NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 4.6 to 10, a binary surfactant mixture composed of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. NRs are grown in this mixture either by aging or by additio...},

  Abstract                 = {Brownian ratchets use a time-varying asymmetric potential that can be applied to separate diffusing particles or molecules. A new type of Brownian ratchet, a geometrical Brownian ratchet, has been realized. Charged, fluorescently labeled phospholipids in a two-dimensional fluid bilayer were driven in one direction by an electric field through a two-dimensional periodic array of asymmetric barriers to lateral diffusion fabricated from titanium oxide on silica. Diffusion spreads the phospholipid molecules in the orthogonal direction, and the asymmetric barriers rectify the Brownian motion, causing a directional transport of molecules. The geometrical ratchet can be used as a continuous molecular sieve to separate mixtures of membrane-associated molecules that differ in electrophoretic mobility and diffusion coefficient.},

Changing the environment can thus alter the emission rate, with potential applications in sensing, integrated photonics and solar energy conversion. Significant increases in emission rate require an optical resonator that stores light in as small a volume as possible, for as long as possible. This is currently achieved using two main systems: photonic crystal microcavities and plasmonic metal nanoparticles. These two systems have largely been developed independently, but the underlying physical mechanisms are the same. Comparing the two provides insight into emission modification and illustrates some of the subtleties involved in interpreting experimental results.},

  Abstract                 = {Single-molecule fluorescence techniques1, 2, 3 are key for a number of applications, including DNA sequencing4, 5, molecular and cell biology6, 7 and early diagnosis8. Unfortunately, observation of single molecules by diffraction-limited optics is restricted to detection volumes in the femtolitre range and requires pico- or nanomolar concentrations, far below the micromolar range where most biological reactions occur2. This limitation can be overcome using plasmonic nanostructures, which enable the confinement of light down to nanoscale volumes9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Although these nanoantennas enhance fluorescence brightness14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, large background signals20, 21, 22 and/or unspecific binding to the metallic surface23, 24, 25 have hampered the detection of individual fluorescent molecules in solution at high concentrations. Here we introduce a novel ‘antenna-in-box’ platform that is based on a gap-antenna inside a nanoaperture. This design combines fluorescent signal enhancement and background screening, offering high single-molecule sensitivity (fluorescence enhancement up to 1,100-fold and microsecond transit times) at micromolar sample concentrations and zeptolitre-range detection volumes. The antenna-in-box device can be optimized for single-molecule fluorescence studies at physiologically relevant concentrations, as we demonstrate using various biomolecules.},

  Abstract                 = {Zero mode waveguides (ZMWs), subwavelength optical nanostructures with dimensions ranging from 50 to 200 nm, have been used to study systems involving ligand-receptor interactions. We show that under proper conditions, lipid membranes will invaginate into the nanostructures, which confine optical excitation to subattoliter volumes. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to characterize the diffusion of fluorescently tagged lipids in liquid-disordered phase 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and gel phase 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) membranes incubated on the nanostructured surface. In contrast to the POPC, DSPC membranes did not appear to enter the structures, suggesting that invagination is dependent on membrane rigidity. Although correlation curves obtained from POPC membranes conformed to previously derived models for diffusion in the evanescent field within the nanostructure, the diffusion constants obtained were systematically lower than expected. The validity of the one-dimensional diffusion model for membrane diffusion is discussed and it is concluded that the erroneous diffusion constants are a result of nontrivial membrane conformation within the ZMWs. Additionally, FCS was used to characterize the fraction of fluorescently labeled tetanus toxin C fragment bound to a ganglioside-populated POPC membrane within the ZMWs. This allowed the determination of the toxin's equilibrium binding constant at a concentration of 500 nM; higher than possible with diffraction-limited FCS. To our knowledge, the results presented here are the first reported for supported lipid bilayers in nanostructured devices. Furthermore, they open the possibility of studying membrane imbedded receptors and proteins at physiological concentrations with single-molecule resolution.},

UV-visible spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm that the particle suspensions of fluorescently labeled core/shell nanoparticles are stable at all stages of their construction. Photophysical investigations reveal strongly distance-dependent fluorescence quenching in these particle systems. The contribution of the metal core to this quenching can be assesed precisely after the gentle dissolution of the gold cores by potassium cyanide.

  Abstract                 = {We combine interferometric detection of single gold nanoparticles, single molecule microscopy, and fluorescence lifetime measurement to study the modification of the fluorescence decay rate of an emitter close to a nanoparticle. In our experiment, gold particles with a diameter of 15 nm were attached to single dye molecules via double-stranded DNA of different lengths. Nanoparticle-induced lifetime modification (NPILM) has promise in serving as a nanoscopic ruler for the distance range well beyond 10 nm, which is the upper limit of fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET). Furthermore, the simultaneous detection of single nanoparticles and fluorescent molecules presented in this work provides new opportunities for single molecule biophysical studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Supported lipid bilayers capture the fluidity and chemical properties of cellular membranes. In this report, we introduce a method for creating surfaces that contain multiple, aligned regions of supported membranes of different compositions at scales of micrometers and smaller. This method uses the design of a diffusional barrier to increase the resolution that can be achieved directly using traditional bilayer patterning techniques, such as laminar flow. We demonstrate the use of this platform for presenting ligands to the T Cell Receptor and LFA-1 that are tethered to separate, closely juxtaposed regions of bilayer, capturing an important aspect of the natural organization observed between T cells and Antigen Presenting Cells. Our results present a novel platform for the study of spatial separation of extracellular ligands and its impact on cell signals.},

These tools relay conformational states, conformational dynamics, and activity of single biological molecules to physical observables, unmasked by ensemble averaging. Distributions and time trajectories of these observables can therefore be measured during a reaction without the impossible need to synchronize all the molecules in the ensemble. The progress in applying these tools to biological studies with the use of fluorophores that are site-specifically attached to macromolecules is reviewed.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe the development of a new methodology to probe the plasma membrane organization of living cells at the nanometric scale. Single nanometric apertures in a metallic film limit the observed membrane area below the optical diffraction barrier. The new approach performs fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with increasing aperture sizes and extracts information on the diffusion process from the whole set of data. In particular, transient diffusion regimes are clearly observed when the probed area comes close to the size of the confining structures. First, this strategy allows identification of the mechanism controlling the diffusion of various fluorescent lipid analogs and green fluorescent protein-tagged proteins. Second, it gives an estimate of the characteristic size of the nanometric membrane heterogeneities, allowing a quantitative study of membrane domains such as lipid rafts. Compared to other optical techniques, this method combines the advantages of high spatio-temporal resolution and direct statistical analysis.},
